          At ITRAANA, every attar is crafted with patience, restraint, and respect
          for tradition. We believe true luxury is not loud — it is deliberate.
          From carefully sourced ingredients to time-honored blending methods,
          each creation is an expression of purity, depth, and quiet confidence.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed tracking-wide opacity-80">
          Our process honors centuries-old perfumery practices, where time is an
          ingredient and restraint is a virtue. Each formulation matures slowly,
          allowing its character to unfold naturally — never rushed, never forced.
          What remains is not just a fragrance, but a lasting presence.
